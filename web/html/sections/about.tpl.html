		<p>I am an enthusiastic full stack web developer ...</p>
		<br/>
		<p>
			After walking the Way of Saint James from Austria to Spain in 2007 I decided to make stuff in a digital way.
			I wanted to get a professional programmer.
		</p>
		<p class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>&nbsp;Done.</p>
		<p>
			Later after university in December 2012 I had been traveling around the world. This time by airplane and
			filled up my tank to get ready to break through in business.
		</p>
		<p class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>&nbsp;Done.</p>
		<p>
			I ended up attending to (un)conferences in Europe and local hackathons.
		</p>
		<p class="text-center"><i class="fa fa-check"></i>&nbsp;Done.</p>
		<p>Since I have been working several years within a small compnany I'm now at a point where I'm deciding what's
			coming next at the end of my parental leave in April 2018. I'm looking for a socialised motivated team where
			I can feel the spirit of creativity and development. I'm looking for a company where unit testing is
			a must, deployment processes are part of the toolchain and where further education is integrated in the
			company's culture.
